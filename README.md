## Portfolio

Hello! :wave:

I'm Renan and this is the portfolio I created to showcase the projects I have been developing in data analytics and data science. I'm proficient in SQL, Excel and Tableau, as well as Python and its libraries (Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib). I have a particular interest in data storytelling, visualisations and statistical analysis.
I'm a trained Architect and Urban Designer and recently I started delving into the world of data. I believe my generalist education and acquired experiences, alongside my curiosity, give me a unique perspective in solving problems with data.
